When adding your guides, please make sure to add the following metadata at the top of the markdown:

```yml
author_name: mineblock11
author_img: https://github.com/mineblock11.png
difficulty: easy|intermediate|advanced
description: This is a description
```

Please make sure to make it suited to the difficulty, no going on about byte ASM manipulations at the easy difficulty! No explaining what a method is at the advanced difficulty! etc.
