### Contributing

Contributing is accepted! Fork and create a PR with your guides or edits.

When adding your guides, please make sure to add the following metadata at the top of the markdown:

```yml
author_name: mineblock11
author_img: https://github.com/mineblock11.png
difficulty: easy|intermediate|advanced
description: This is a description
```

Please make sure to make it suited to the difficulty, no going on about byte ASM manipulations at the easy difficulty! No explaining what a method is at the advanced difficulty! etc. 

### Advert Disclaimer

This page isn't free to host, without adverts these guides wouldn't be able to be hosted - I pay $5.99 a month for a `cloudflared` proxy that allows me to host all content on the mineblock11 domain. All money from adverts go back into my sites, it isn't a profit thing.
