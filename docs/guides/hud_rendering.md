description: Draw textures, text and spawn Toasts on the player's hud using the HudRenderCallback event.

# HUD Rendering

In this guide, you will learn how to render text on the screen using the TextRenderer and Fabric's HudRenderCallback

This guide is made for 1.19.x and above, there is no guarantee it will work below 1.19.x.

## Prerequisites

You will need basic knowledge of Java to begin this guide. If you do not know how to program in Java with Gradle, please check out these beginner guides before continuing:

- [Java Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/java/)
- [Gradle: Building A Java App](https://www.baeldung.com/gradle-building-a-java-app)

You will obviously need IntelliJ IDEA and the Minecraft Dev plugin.

## Getting Started

First, create a new Fabric Mod project in the `Create Project` menu of IntelliJ, fill out the details.

Once your project has completed generating, we can start in the client initializer class.
Please make sure all this code is on the client! This is all client-sided code and will cause a crash if used on the server.

## Rendering Text
We will be using Fabric's HudRenderCallback event to render on screen. This could also be done by using a mixin on `InGameHud`. We will use the event though. Add this to your onInitializeClient() method
```java
HudRenderCallback.EVENT.register((matrixStack, tickDelta) -> {
    MinecraftClient minecraftClient = MinecraftClient.getInstance();
    TextRenderer textRenderer = minecraftClient.textRenderer;
    if (textRenderer == null) return;

    textRenderer.drawWithShadow(matrixStack, "Hello World!", 0, 0, 0xffffff);
});
```
This will render "Hello World" at the top left of your screen! If you want to draw a string without the shadow, use `textRenderer.draw` instead.

## Rendering Textures
We're just going to render the Minecraft apple texture but this is applicable to any texture, including custom ones. Add this code inside the callback, and adjust it to your needs.
```java
RenderSystem.setShaderTexture(0, new Identifier("minecraft", "textures/item/apple.png")); // Set the texture to render
DrawableHelper.drawTexture(matrixStack, 10, 10, 50, 50, 0, 0, 10, 10, 10, 10); // Render on the screen at X:10 Y:10 and size 50
```
If you did this right, you should see an apple rendered at the top left of your screen! (it should look something like this)

## Simple Toasts
These are kind of like the tips you may sometimes recieve when beginning the game, or advancement notifications. Please keep in mind, do not run this in some sort of ticking method, or render method like we used before. This could cause a crash. Here is a simple system toast:
```java
SystemToast.add(MinecraftClient.getInstance().getToastManager(), SystemToast.Type.TUTORIAL_HINT, Text.literal("Title"), Text.literal("This is a description"));
``` 
The `SystemToast.Type` can be changed to whatever you want, experiment and see what fits! This is an image of what the toast would look like if you used the code provided. Pretty nice!
